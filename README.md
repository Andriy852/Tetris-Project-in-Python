# Tetris Project in Python

This is a classic Tetris game implemented using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The game allows you to control falling tetrominoes, complete lines, and score points.

## How to Run the Game
1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

2. **Install Dependencies**: If Tkinter is not installed with your Python, you can install it using the following:
* For macOS (using Homebrew)
   ```bash
   brew install tcl-tk
   ```
* For Windows/Linux: Tkinter is generally included with Python, but you may need to install the python3-tk package via your system's package manager if it's missing.
3. **Run the Game**: Open a terminal and run the main.py file:
```bash
python main.py
```
